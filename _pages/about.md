" We choose to do this not because it is easy, but because it is hard " 

I am a PhD student at Hans Knoell Institute in Jena, Germany. My interests spans from filamentous fungi to humans. I'm curious about human-fungal interactions -- countless questions that one could ask: How does RNA work? How does host RNA change during fungal infections? How does fungal RNA change? 

Biology can also be applied: I study pathogenic fungi for the development of RNA-based theraputics to cure fungal infections.
